# WorldWise2

Welcome to **WorldWise2**, a demo project created to practice and enhance React.js skills. This is not a real application but a learning exercise designed to explore and implement various features of React.js.

## About the Project

The design of this project was crafted by **Jonas S.**, while all the features and functionality were implemented by me. The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with React.js and improve my understanding of its core concepts.

## Features

- Dynamic and interactive UI components.
- State management using React hooks.
- Modular and reusable component structure.
- Currently optimized for desktop and large iPads (responsive design may be implemented in the future).

## Purpose

This project serves as a sandbox for experimenting with React.js concepts and building confidence in creating React-based applications. It is not intended for production use.

## Acknowledgments

- Special thanks to **Jonas S.** for providing the design inspiration.
- Gratitude to the React.js community for their excellent resources and documentation.

## Disclaimer

This is a demo project and is not intended to be a fully functional application.
